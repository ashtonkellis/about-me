  <h1>Learn a little about your ole' friend Ashton.</h1>
  
  // question #1
  <h2>Am I a native Seattlite?</h2>
    <p>No! Like 93.6% of the people that live in Seattle, I grew up in California!</p>

  // question #2
  <h2>In 2010, did I ride my bicycle all the way from San Fransisco to Virginia?</h2>
    <p>No! I tried to, but I had to get a ride over the Sierra Nevada mountains from a mule breeder so that I wouldn't freeze to death in a freak June blizzard!</p>

  // question #3
    <h2>Do I have a wife?</h2>
      <p>Yes! I recently got married to my lovely wife :)</p>

  // question #4
    <h2>Do I have any pets?</h2>
      <p>Technically, no! But I like to think that I still have a dog, she just lives in doggy heaven! RIP Macy! You always were a glutton, even for an entire box of snail poison, apparently :(</p>

  // question #5
    <h2>Do you like sports?</h2>
      <p>No! I don't understand sportsball at all! Sometimes they throw it through a hoop, sometimes they kick around a panda-egg, sometimes they wear armor and run into eachother... it's all very confusing!</p>

<!-- 
The questions in the guessing game must require a mix of yes/no answers, and user input must accept either y/n or yes/no responses, with either .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() used to validate the user input and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.

Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.
