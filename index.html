      <h2>Questions about me.</h2>
      <!-- question #1 -->
      <h3>Am I a native Seattlite?</h3>
      <p>No! Like 93.6% of the people that live in Seattle, I grew up in California!</p>

      <!-- question #2 -->
      <h3>Have I successfully ridden my bicycle all the way from San Fransisco to Virginia?</h3>
      <p>No! I tried to, but I had to get a ride over the Sierra Nevada mountains from a friendly mule breeder so that I wouldn't freeze to death in a freak June blizzard!</p>

      <!-- question #3 -->
      <h3>Do I have a wife?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I recently got married to my lovely wife :)</p>

      <!-- question #4 -->
      <h3>Do I have any pets?</h3>
      <img src="img/macy.PNG" alt="ashton's dog macy, who currently lives in doggy heaven">
      <p>Technically, no! But I like to think that I still have a dog, she just lives in doggy heaven! RIP Macy! You always were a glutton, even for an entire box of snail poison, apparently.</p>
      <p>I also have an ant farm, but I only have one ant. Her name is Beyonce. She's a queen but she ate all of her eggs, so I don't think that she counts as a real pet. My wife would describe her as a 'Pest', not a 'Pet'.</p>

      <!-- question #5 -->
      <h3>Do I like sports?</h3>
      <p>No! I don't understand sportsball at all! Sometimes they throw an orange thing through a hoop, sometimes they kick around a panda-egg, sometimes they wear plastic armor and run into eachother... it's all very confusing!</p>

      <!-- question #6   -->
      <h3>How many pairs of pants do I own?</h3>
      <p>Four! Exactly four! No more, no less! I'm a minimalist.</p>
      
      <!-- question #7 -->
      <h3>Can you guess a state that I've lived in?</h3>
      <p>I've worked in California, Washington, and Maine. Washington is my favorite, because I don't like paying state income taxes :)</p>
